haskellInfo ="Haskell Brooks Curry (September 12, 1900 â€“ September 1, 1982) was an American mathematician and logician. Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic; Curry is also known for Curry's paradox and the Curry-Howard correspondence. There are three programming languages named after him, Haskell, Brooks and Curry, as well as the concept of currying, a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science."
